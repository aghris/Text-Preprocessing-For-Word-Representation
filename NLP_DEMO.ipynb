In first place, we perfom each tool individually to evaluate its effect on the perfomance results then, in second place we use all the processing factors together. On other hand, we incorporate only basic processing into the text used as input for the classification.\n","Implementing negation and Spellercheck techniques requires constracting the antonym dictionary and the customized dictionary of correction, which takes to much time. We will not implement them, but since we are working on an affective task we remove negation expression from stop word list such as 'no', 'never', 'neither'...\n","Due to the machines perfomance limitation we used only two word embedding models: CBOW and Skip-gram.
